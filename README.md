Recording voiceovers for instructional and demo videos can take hours - and sometimes even days if youâ€™re a professional at having to start over! But wouldnâ€™t it be great if you could get the job done at 10x the speed and perfect on the first try? This sample provides the basic logic to convert text to speech using the OpenAI Audio APIâ€™s speech endpoint. Gone are the days of hours at the microphone!
